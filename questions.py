    Available identifiers and examples:
    - question_1: Questions about customers with CM% thresholds and optional date filters, including listing customers, average CM, total revenue, and CM distribution.
        Examples for question_1:
        - "List customers with CM > 90% last quarter"
        - "Show customers with CM less than 30%"
        - "What is the CM for customers between 10% and 15% in January 2023?"
        - "Show me all customers with their CM"
        - "What is the average CM for all customers?"
        - "List customers with CM greater than 20%"
        - "Customers with CM less than 50% in Q1 2024"
        - "Give me the contribution margin details for all clients"
    - question_2: Questions about specific cost increases/drops for a segment over time (month-over-month comparison).
        Examples for question_2:
        - "Which cost triggered the Margin drop last month as compared to its previous month in Transportation"
        - "Show me cost increases in Healthcare for July 2024 compared to June"
        - "What expenses went up in Retail last quarter?"
    - question_3: Questions asking for C&B cost variation between any two specified periods (months or quarters).
        Examples for question_3:
        - "How much C&B varied from last quarter to this quarter"
        - "C&B cost variation between FY26 Q1 and FY25 Q4"
        - "Compare C&B for FY25 Q4 and FY26 Q2"
        - "What's the difference in C&B between this quarter and last quarter?"
        - "How much C&B varied from April 2025 to May 2025"
        - "Compare C&B for last month and this month"
        - "C&B variation between June 2025 and July 2024"
    - question_4: Questions about the Month-over-Month (M-o-M) trend of C&B cost as a percentage of total revenue.
        Examples for question_4:
        - "What is M-o-M trend of C&B cost % w.r.t total revenue"
        - "Show me the monthly C&B cost as a percentage of revenue"
        - "C&B cost to revenue trend over time"
        - "Analyze C&B cost percentage of revenue month over month"
        - "C&B as % of revenue trend for last 6 months"
    - question_5: Questions about Year-over-Year (YoY), Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ), or Month-over-Month (MoM) revenue trends, often segmented by DU, BU, or account.
        Examples for question_5:
        - "What is the YoY, QoQ, MoM revenue for DU/BU/account"
        - "Show me the quarterly revenue trend by DU"
        - "Give me the month over month revenue for specific accounts"
        - "Analyze yearly revenue changes for all BUs"
        - "What's the QoQ revenue for account 'XYZ'?"
